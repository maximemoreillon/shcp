This is a Node.js web app that allows users to control and monitor IoT devices.

Currently, the app can handle the following type of devices:

* MQTT enabled lights
* MQTT enabled heaters
* MQTT enabled fans
* MQTT enabled sensors

The app was mainly built so as to learn about Node.js and is not intended to compete with existing software sharing the same purpose such as home assistant.
